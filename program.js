//document.writeln("Hello, World!");

// the isNan(number) function tells you if a value is a number or not,
// if you type a number in the pass through it will return false because the value is an actual number,
// however if you were to type a value that is not a number i.e. a string, words, dates, etc.
//you would get a value of true because those values are not numbers.
//console.log(isNaN("hello"));

//practice with weather APP
